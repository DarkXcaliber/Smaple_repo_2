    <h1><p style="color:red">This is a brand new website and it's all about a game called "Brawl Stars".</h1>
    <p>Here I am going to be talking about Brawl Stars and how I feel about it.
    First let's start with how will we play the game.
    We have to defeat enemy brawlers, open up boxes and unlock new brawlers and earn trophies by winning battles and of course, losing trophies by losing battles.
    There are 7 types of brawlers and those are - Trophy road, rares, super rares, epics, mythics, legendaries and chromatics.
    We have now completed learning about the mechanics of the game, now lets go deeper into this fun and overwhelming game.
    We need to have luck on our side to get new brawlers or let's go with the scientific way. We have to open more and more boxes to get brawlers surprisingly.
    If we get really lucky or open many boxes then we might get a legendary.
    If you think that this game is all about luck, then I'm sorry but, you are wrong. This game needs some amazing skills.
    Brawl Stars has some good graphics too!
    Now lets talk about my profile. Let's go!
    I have 14771/50000 trophies, 29/100 members in my club (Leon SquadðŸ˜±), 38/48 brawlers (all trophy roads, rares, super rares, epics, 1/8 mythics, 3/5 legendaries and 5/7 chromatics.)
    Now what I think and how I feel about Brawl Stars:-
    Well, I think its a pretty good game and is suitable for kids so make sure to download it and I feel relaxed and less stressful when I play the game, although it can be very frustrating sometimes.</p>
